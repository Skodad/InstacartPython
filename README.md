# InstacartPython
This project focused on the online grocery store Instacart.  The goal was to uncover more information about the sales patterns of their existing client base.  Instacart wanted to apply a targeted marketing strategy by using different marketing campaigns to target specific customer demographics.  
## Objective
The primary objective was to perform an inital data and exploratory analysis of their data to develop insights and recommend strategies to the 
Instacart marketing team.  This would help the marketing team segment their customer base in order to improve sales based on particular customer shopping behaviors.  

We were provided with four datasets that combied contained all te customer information.  After wrangling, cleaning and checking for inconsistencies within the datasets, I merged them into one complete dataframe for
further analysis.  Additional columns were added in order to determine specific ordering frequencies and patterns.  

The basket analysis was separated into five folders: Project Management, Data, SCripts, Analysis and sent to client.

Project Management: Contains the Project Brief

Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data.  These contain the original dataframes and the dataframes after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively.

Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process

Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report

Sent To Client: Contains the Final Report
