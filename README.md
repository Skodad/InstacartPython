Repository for Instacart Analysis
This project focused on the online grocery store Instacart.  The goal was to uncover more information about the sales patterns of their existing client base.  Instacart wanted to apply a targeted marketing strategy
by using different marketing campaigns to target specific customer demographics.  My task was to perform an inital data and exploratory analysis of their data to develop insights and provide strategies to the 
Instacart marketing team.  I used the data to create different customer profiles based on different criteria in order to deduce how the different customer demographics behaved based on serveal factors, including 
when they shopped and what they shopped for.  

We were provided with four datasets that combied contained all te customer information.  After wrangling, cleaning and checking for inconsistencies within the datasets, I merged them into one complete dataframe for
further analysis.  Additional columns were added in order to determine specific ordering frequencies and patterns.  The basket analysis was separated into five folders: Project Management, Data, SCripts, Analysis 
and sent to client.
Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data.  These contain the original dataframes and the dataframes after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively.
Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
Sent To Client: Contains the Final Report
